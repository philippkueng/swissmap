#SwissMap

## Getting it running

Until now SwissMap only consists of a static html page, however since parts of the Javascript for the browser is are written in CoffeeScript compilation is necessary before you can deploy it on your server. To do that follow the recipe below, which was written for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

**Install Node.js**

  $ sudo apt-get install g++ gcc openssl libssl-dev git-core -y
  $ cd /your/home/directory
  $ git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git
  $ cd node/
  $ ./configure
  $ sudo make
  $ sudo make install
  
**Install Node Packet Manager (NPM)**
 
 $ cd /your/home/directory
 $ git clone git://github.com/isaacs/npm.git
 $ cd npm/
 $ sudo make install
 
**Install CoffeeScript**

  $ sudo npm install coffee-script -g
  
**Cloning SwissMap**

  $ cd /your/home/directory
  $ git clone git://github.com/philippkueng/swissmap.git
  
**Compiling CoffeeScript files**

  $ cd swissmap/js
  $ coffee --compile *.coffee
  
**Done**

Now open 'index.html' with your browser or put this folder onto your server to serve it to the public.
